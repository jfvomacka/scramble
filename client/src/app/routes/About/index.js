        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Cool, but... what is Senior SCramble?</h3>
        <p> Senior Scramble is a fun way for graduating seniors to make some new connections
          before graduation, whether that means making a new friend or something more ;) </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p> You’ll sign up with your USC email and enter some basic information (your name, your school, a profile picture, and a way to get in contact).
        As soon as you’ve created your profile you’ll be able to add any other senior who’s made a profile on the site, 
        and if the two of you match you’ll get each other’s preferred method of contact. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Is there any survey to fill out?</h3>
        <p> Nope! Senior Scramble is totally self-driven. You get to match with as many people as you want! But if you need some help, we’ve created a page </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Is there a limit to how many people I can match with?</h3>
        <p> Nope! Send a match to your friends, send a match to your writing 150 crush, 
        send a match to the senior whose Zoom video you pin!  </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>If I match with someone and they don’t match with me back, will they know?</h3>
        <p> Senior Scramble is a fun way for graduating seniors to make some new connections
          before graduation, whether that means making a new friend or something more ;) </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>I matched with someone! Now what?</h3>
        <p> Reach out to them! After you’ve matched with someone you’ll receive their preferred 
        form of contact (Instagram, Email, their number). We encourage you to reach out and find out why they wanted to match with <i>you</i>!  </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>My match and I are meeting up in person, how should we deal with COVID safety precautions?</h3>
        <p> That’s for the two of you to decide! Senior Scramble is not liable for anything that
        happens after two users have matched, and the type of contact you choose to initiate. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>What type of information is public on Senior Scramble?</h3>
        <p> Your name, school, and profile picture are public but your preferred method of contact is only 
        available to you and anyone you match with. None of the information on your Senior 
        Scramble profile will be shared outside of Senior Scramble or with third party companies. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
