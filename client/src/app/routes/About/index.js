        <h3>Cool, but... what is Senior SCramble?</h3>
        <p> Senior Scramble is a fun way for graduating seniors to make some new connections
          before graduation, whether that means making a new friend or something more ;) </p>

        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p> You’ll sign up with your USC email and enter some basic information (your name, your school, a profile picture, and a way to get in contact).</p>
        <p> As soon as you’ve created your profile you’ll be able to add any other senior who’s made a profile on the site, </p>
        <p>and if the two of you match you’ll get each other’s preferred method of contact. </p>

        <h3>Is there any survey to fill out?</h3>
        <p> Nope! Senior Scramble is totally self-driven. You get to match with as many people as you want! But if you need some help, we’ve created a page </p>

        <h3>Is there a limit to how many people I can match with?</h3>
        <p> Nope! Send a match to your friends, send a match to your writing 150 crush, </p>
        <p> send a match to the senior whose zoom video you pin!  </p>

        <h3>If I match with someone and they don’t match with me back, will they know?</h3>
        <p> Senior Scramble is a fun way for graduating seniors to make some new connections
          before graduation, whether that means making a new friend or something more ;) </p>

        <h3>I matched with someone! Now what?</h3>
        <p> Reach out to them! After you’ve matched with someone you’ll receive their preferred </p>
        <p> form of contact (Instagram, Email, their number). We encourage you to reach out and find out why they wanted to match with you!  </p>

        <h3>My match and I are meeting up in person, how should we deal with COVID safety precautions?</h3>
        <p> That’s for the two of you to decide! Senior Scramble is not liable for anything that.</p>
        <p>happens after two users have matched, and the type of contact you choose to initiate. </p>

        <h3>What type of information is public on Senior Scramble?</h3>
        <p> Your name, school, and profile picture are public but your preferred method of contact is only .</p>
        <p> available to you and anyone you match with. None of the information on your Senior </p>
        <p>Scramble profile will be shared outside of Senior Scramble or with third party companies. </p>

        <h3> I have another question, who can I ask?</h3>
        <p> Email uscseniorscramble@gmail.com with any questions and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can! </p>
